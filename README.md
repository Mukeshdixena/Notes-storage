# Notes-Storage ML Project

## Overview

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to enhance the organization and retrieval of notes. By implementing advanced algorithms, the goal is to provide users with a more intelligent and efficient way to manage their notes.

## Features

- **Intelligent Categorization:** The system employs machine learning algorithms to automatically categorize notes based on content, making it easier for users to find relevant information.

- **Smart Tagging:** Tags are generated dynamically using natural language processing (NLP) to extract key concepts from the notes. This helps users quickly identify the main themes and topics covered in each note.

- **Search Enhancement:** The search functionality is powered by a machine learning model that understands user queries and provides more accurate and relevant results.

- **Security:** Notes are stored securely with encryption to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of user data.
